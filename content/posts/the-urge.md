> When I feel sad, I just update

No, seriously. I know people do all sorts of things while angry, sad or frustrated of life.
Of course, I'm no different from any other human on this planet so I have to *throw out* all these negative emotions.
The way I like to express my feelings are different.. *kinda*. So, when I feel sad, I open up my terminal and type:

```bash
pacman -Syyu
```

It's refreshing and fun to see all these horizontal lines appear on my screen and slowly getting full (I don't have a
fast internet connection anyway...) for several times, until a message pops-up and says `there is nothing to do`.

*I take some seconds to contemplate the fact that it's now the fifth time in one minute that 
pacman screamed me to stop this torture*

Bored, I take out my phone, unlock it and open the App Store. I reach the small profile icon in the right-top corner
of the page and open the updates page. With only a small force applied, I reach the top and drag the window down,
waiting for that juicy moment of the **new updates** page to appear. A small, circular loading icon appears only for
a fraction of a second, then it gives me the same page as before. Nothing changed. No updates.

Other times, when updates are to be found, I just feel happy contemplating the blue "loading update" icon on the phone.
Seriously. This is *not* madness (I hope). Everybody has something repetitive and cringy that does to express these feelings.

It's just part of being alive and being a computer scientist.
